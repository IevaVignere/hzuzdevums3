The MPL 2.0 is a weak copyleft license that requires modified files to remain open-source under the MPL, but it allows combining these files with proprietary code. In contrast, the Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license that imposes no such restrictions, allowing modifications and combinations with proprietary software without requiring the source code to be open.

The Apache License also provides stronger patent protection, while the MPL focuses on file-level transparency. Both licenses require attribution and proper notice when redistributing code, but the Apache License is more broadly compatible with other open-source licenses.
